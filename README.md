Airbnb is an American company based out of San Francisco that operates as an online marketplace for various forms of lodging. What's game changing about AirBnb is that is departs from the business models of traditional lodging where large corporations own and provide rentals for a given rate; Airbnb offers private homeowners the platform to list their own proerties for rent for a given period of time, giving homeowners a new way to add value to their property. This business model has proven astonishingly successful given Airbnbs rate of growth, but what is the impact on our cities? More importantly, is there anything that we can suggest to help circumvent any unwanted side effects of Airbnbs's meteoric rise to success? Lastly, what makes a successful, profitable Airbnb that can benefit both hosts and the community?

New York City has the most available data going for it, as procured by Inside AirBnB, StreetEasy, and the NYC Open Data website, so we use New York City as a case study to get an idea of how Airbnb effects society on the largest stage, and the findings here act as a sprinboard to launch similar studies for different cities.

The code and data documented in this repository is used to...

  - Import data from InsideAirbnb to get information on current listings, historical reviews, etc.
